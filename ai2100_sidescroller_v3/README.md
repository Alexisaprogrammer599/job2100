AI Engineer — Timeline Side-Scroller (v3)
- No deaths: obstacles increase Risk and reduce Honor, but never kill the player.
- Honor (0-100) and Risk (0-200) determine multiple endings when you reach 2100.
- Role: You are an AI engineer. Collect milestones (green orbs) to advance through history from 1950 → 2100.
- Controls: A/D or arrows move, Space jump, Shift dash, M mute, P toggles presentation captions, R restart.
- To run: Unzip and open index.html in a modern browser.

Endings logic:
- High Honor (>=65) & low Risk (<=30) → Uplift / Partnership Achieved
- Low Honor (<=35) & high Risk (>=60) → Breakdown / Unchecked Risk (uprising-like)
- Otherwise → Mixed Future / Coexistence with Tradeoffs
