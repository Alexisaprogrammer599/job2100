# AI 2100: Side-Scroller
A single-file HTML5 canvas game for presentations about how AI might shape jobs and hobbies by the year 2100.

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). No build step needed.

## Controls
- **A/D or â—€/â–¶**: move
- **Space**: jump
- **Shift**: dash (short boost)
- **M**: mute/unmute blips
- **P**: presentation mode (pop-up captions that explain metaphor mapping)
- **R**: restart

## Gameplay
Collect green orbs (AI upgrades) to see quick notes on domains like jobs, hobbies, healthcare, research, and more. Avoid red drones and spikes that represent risks like hype, misuse, and legacy constraints. As your score rises, a certain hooded cameo may float by ðŸ˜‰.

## Assets
- `assets/palpatine.png`: a small hooded-villain pixel sprite (64Ã—64 PNG) suitable for side-scrolling cameo use.

## Customize
Open `script.js` and tweak:
- `notes[]` array to swap or add your own domain notes for your talk.
- `state.maxSpeed` to change difficulty scaling.
- Colors and shapes for obstacles/pickups to fit your theme.

## Attribution
All code and the hooded-villain sprite here are newly created for your project.
